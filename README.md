# python-project-for-movie-recommendation
This Python-based movie recommendation system is based on machine learning. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to suggest films to users based on content similarities.

🚀 Main Features 📄 Content-Based Filtering: Makes movie recommendations by looking at cast, crew, overviews, genres, and keywords.

🔍 Cosine Similarity with TF-IDF: Determines how similar two films are based on textual metadata.

The TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset is used for clean dataset integration.

⚙️ Efficient and Simple Logic: Easy to learn and lightweight.

💻 Jupyter Notebook Friendly: Perfect for resume portfolios, hackathons, and educational projects.

The Tech Stack
Popular Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity calculations are used in the project's development. For simple text, Regex and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) are utilised.
